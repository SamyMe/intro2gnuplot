plot for [i=1:4] 'Algo'.i using 1:2 title 'Algo'.i with lines

# The variable "i" takes the values 1 to 4 . So a translation of this would be:
# plot 'Algo1' using 1:2 title 'Algo1' with lines, 'Algo2' using 1:2 title 'Algo2' with lines, 'Algo3' using 1:2 title 'Algo3' with lines, 'Algo4' using 1:2 title 'Algo4' with lines,
