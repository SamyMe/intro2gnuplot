###3- Tips and trics:

1. Rotate data in axis for lisibility:
Lets take the example of a population growth (million person) during the years. Data is as follows:

[Data3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamyMe/intro2gnuplot/master/Data3):
```text
1990 40
1991 41
1992 41
1993 42 
1994 42
1995 42
(...)
```

We can see in the figure bellow that there is a lisibility problem, which we are going to solve by rotating the display of the years in the following script:

[Script3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamyMe/intro2gnuplot/master/Script3):

The result will be as follows:

2. Using variables:
We can generalise a script to use it with different data files, by the use of variables.
Lets use the following data files [Data1] and [Data3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamyMe/intro2gnuplot/master/Data1] and [Data3).
The script will look like this:

[Script4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamyMe/intro2gnuplot/master/Script4)

The graph will then be generated with the following command:
gnuplot scriptfile title=blahnlah xtitle=.... ytitlee=....
The result will be as follows:

3. Using the *for* loop:

When we have a repeated task to do, wecan use a loop to helps us.
For example, we want to draw a graph representing the time taken by 6 different algorithms to check whether a number is prime or not.
Data are represented in different files: [Algo1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamyMe/intro2gnuplot/master/Algo1) [Algo2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamyMe/intro2gnuplot/master/Algo2) [Algo3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamyMe/intro2gnuplot/master/Algo3) [Algo4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamyMe/intro2gnuplot/master/Algo4) 
The script will be:

[Script5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamyMe/intro2gnuplot/master/Script5)


The result will be as follows:
