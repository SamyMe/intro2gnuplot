###2- Multiple graphs

Lets take the same example. But this time, we are also measuring the "humidit√©" level.
So our file would look like this:

[Data2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamyMe/intro2gnuplot/master/Data2):
```text
1 29 64
2 31 62
3 30 69
4 28 67
(...)
```

Only one line is going to be modified in our script file:
[Script2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamyMe/intro2gnuplot/master/Script2):

The result will be as follows:
![Graph2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamyMe/intro2gnuplot/master/Graph2.png)
